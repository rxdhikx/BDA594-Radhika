## What is Big Data according to me:
:electron: Big data is essentially a massive volume of unorganised information about something which is not really useful to mankind if not treated or analysed properly. Nowadays, with the advancement of technology and various resources 
available to interpret and analyse the data like Power BI, Tableau, Machine Learning, Apache Spark etc, we can make out some meaningful insights with the data presented in front of us which could benefit the mankind, businesses
and the society as a whole in unimaginable ways. Big data is just a huge chunk of data points managed by the people and/or technology. And when treated with creativity, it could do wonders!
